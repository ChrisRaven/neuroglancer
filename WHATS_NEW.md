### 🌱 Febuary 2020 💖
## Global Undo and Redo
* Undo `⬅️` or Redo `➡️` any local changes made in Neuroglancer.
 * Redo is only avaliable if you make no changes after Undo.
 * Undo and Redo are avaliable per session. Reloading the page will clear the Undo/Redo history.
 * Making multiple changes at once will batch them together when undo/redoing.
