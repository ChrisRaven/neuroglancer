# Split Preview
* Ever wanted to see the results of your actions before you perform them?
* You're in luck! The new split preview button allows you to see forward in time!
* The split preview button is available for ChunkedGraph segmentation layers in the graph tab.
* In the Multicut group, it is the rightmost button that looks like a crystal ball.
* When performing a split, the split preview will show you what changes your split will make in 2D, without actually changing the underlying segmentation.
* Hit the crystall ball to toggle between split preview mode and regular multicut mode.

# Multicut surrounding segment opacity
* You can now control the opacity of the surrounding segments while performing a multicut, if you wish to view more context. Use the range slider in the "Multicut Opacity" group to do so.
